Utilities for Exoplanet Astronomy in R

This folder contains a few (okay, fine, as of 7.27.2017: two) R functions that I have written to make my exoplanet data analysis and/or figure-making a tad bit easier. My application is the spectra of transiting exoplanets, so that's what the functions are designed for, though that could change as I add more. 

This was set up approximately as simply as possible, after reading this blog post from Hilary Parker:
